        <p>Welcome to my website, my name is Steve Bottos. I am currently working towards a research-based Master's degree (MaSc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with my research dealing mainly with the realms of Machine Learning and Data Science. Here you'll find some information about myself as well as some past projects and works-in-progress. I hope that you enjoy my work as much as I enjoyed producing it. For more about me, head to the "[About](https://stevebottos.github.io/about/)" section. Check out the feed below for some of my most recent work, or check out the "[Projects](https://stevebottos.github.io/projects/)" page.</p>
