## The Hockey Summit Website
<a href="http://thehockeysummit.com/" target="_blank">TheHockeySummit.com</a> is an ongoing project of mine. The coach of the San Diego Gulls and founder of THS, Justin Roethlingshoefer, had approached me asking if I was available to work on the site for him in early 2018. I was, and still am, a bit of a web-dev hobbyist so I welcomed the opportunity to work on something new. I currently manage any front-end or back-end changes to the site that must be implemented as the company grows.
